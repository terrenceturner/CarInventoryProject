# CarInventoryProject
I created a car inventory system that keep track of an inventory of cars. The app will track the following data about the cars in inventory:
1.	Make
2.	Model
3.	Year
4.	Color
5.	Miles on the odometer

The application will allow the user to do the following:
1.	Add a car to inventory
2.	Delete a car from inventory
3.	List all the cars in inventory
4.	Search for cars by:
    a.	Make
    b.	Model
    c.	Year
    d.	Color
    e.	Less than a certain number of miles
